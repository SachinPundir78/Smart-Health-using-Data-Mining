⚙️ Setup Instructions
Clone the repository:
git clone <repository-url>
cd smart_health
Create a virtual environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Update the configuration:
Edit the config.yaml file to specify paths for datasets, saved models, and other parameters. 📝
Run the application:
streamlit run app.py

🚀 Usage
🧠 Training the Model
Specify the model type (e.g., Random Forest) in main.py.
Run the script:
python main.py
The trained model will be saved in the saved_model/ directory. 🛠️
🔬 Testing the Model
Evaluate the model's performance using test_model.py:
python test_model.py
🌐 Using the Streamlit App
Launch the app:
streamlit run app.py
Use the web interface to make disease predictions. 🖥️✨

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 🐍: Core programming language.
Streamlit 🌐: For building the web interface.
Scikit-learn 📚: For machine learning models.
Pandas 🐼: For data manipulation.
PyYAML 📝: For configuration management.

📊 Dataset
The project uses two datasets:
training_data.csv: 📄 Dataset for training the model.
test_data.csv: 📄 Dataset for testing the model.
Each dataset includes:
🩺 Patient symptoms (features).
🏥 Disease prognosis (labels).
