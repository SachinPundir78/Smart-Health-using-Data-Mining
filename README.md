Setup Instructions
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd smart_health
Create a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Update the configuration:

Edit the config.yaml file to specify the paths for datasets, saved models, and other parameters.
Run the application:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Usage
Training the Model
To train the model:

Edit main.py to specify the model type (e.g., Random Forest).
Run the script:
bash
Copy code
python main.py
The trained model will be saved in the saved_model/ directory.
Testing the Model
To test the model:

Use test_model.py to evaluate the model's performance on the test dataset:
bash
Copy code
python test_model.py
Using the Streamlit App
Launch the Streamlit app by running streamlit run app.py.
Use the interactive UI to make disease predictions.
Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language.
Streamlit: For building the web interface.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning models.
Pandas: For data manipulation.
PyYAML: For configuration management.
Dataset
The project uses two CSV files:

training_data.csv: Dataset for training the model.
test_data.csv: Dataset for testing the model.
Each dataset contains:

Patient symptoms as features.
Disease prognosis as labels.
